    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This paper employ Khang’s definition of the partial derivative of a matrix with respect to a vector and the Kronecker product to define translational and rotational Hessian matrices. With these definitions, the generalized velocities in the expression of a linear acceleration or an angular acceleration are collected into a quadratic term. The relations of Jacobian and Hessian matrices in relative motion are then established. A new matrix form of Lagrange’s equations showing clearly the quadratic term of generalized velocities is also introduced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={1}, journal={Vietnam Journal of Science and Technology}, author={Tuan, Nguyen Thai Minh and Chung, Pham Thanh and Khoa, Do Dang and Phong, Phan Dang},
